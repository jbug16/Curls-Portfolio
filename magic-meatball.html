                    <h3>Game Design</h3>
                    <p>"Magic Meatball" is a single-player, action-puzzle game where players manage two interconnected kitchensâ€”a public restaurant and a hidden potion shop. The game's core mechanics revolve around mirroring player movements in both spaces, challenging players to balance cooking orders and potion-making simultaneously. The magical and strategic theme adds depth, combining fast-paced gameplay with thoughtful planning.</p>
                    <h5>Game Objective</h5>
                    <p>In "Magic Meatball," players strive to efficiently run a restaurant and a secret potion shop at the same time. The main goal is to balance customer orders, potion crafting, and ingredient management while keeping both sides operating smoothly. Success is determined by how fast a player can make 10 orders.</p>
                    <h5>Gameplay Mechanics</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mirrored Movement:</strong> Players control a chef whose movements are mirrored on the y-axis between the restaurant and potion shop. This mechanic requires careful positioning and planning to manage both kitchens effectively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cooking and Potion Crafting:</strong> Players must prepare meals in the restaurant while also brewing potions in the hidden shop. Each kitchen has different orders and preparation methods, adding complexity to the gameplay.</li>
                        <li><strong>Throwing Items:</strong> Items that are not needed in one kitchen can be thrown through a magical mirror to the other kitchen. This mechanic requires quick decision-making to ensure the right ingredients are in the correct place at the right time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time and Resource Management:</strong> Balancing time and resources is crucial as players work to fulfill orders and maintain customer satisfaction. Failing to manage these elements can lead to overwhelmed kitchens and game failure.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Art and Audio Design</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Visual Style:</strong> The game features a cartoonish pixel art style, with distinct differences in color and tone between the restaurant and the potion shop. The chef's "light" and "shadow" versions mirror each other, visually reinforcing the dual-world concept.</li>
                        <li><strong>Audio Experience:</strong> The soundtrack combines upbeat diner music with subtle haunting undertones, creating a contrast between the chaotic kitchen environment and the hidden, mystical world of the potion shop. Sound effects are synthesized to match the game's playful, retro aesthetic.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Score and Critiques</h3>
                    <p>"Magic Meatball" excelled in its artistic style, achieving #1 with a perfect 5.000 score. Reviewers praised the retro pixel art and the creative use of light and shadow. The game's theme interpretation also scored well, placing #233 with 4.000 points. However, feedback on mechanics and playability was more mixed, with rankings of #755 and #804 (both 3.000).</p>
                    <p>Players enjoyed the mirrored movement mechanic but found it chaotic and sometimes overwhelming. A common suggestion was to improve guidance for new players, as many were unclear about how to manage controls and deliver food. Other recommendations included adjusting ingredient drops, adding obstacles for strategy, and incorporating tutorials. Overall, the game's innovative concept and replayability were appreciated, with players expressing interest in expanded levels and refined mechanics.</p>

                    <h3>Cooking and Crafting Items</h3>
                    <p>This feature allows players to interact with machines to cook meals or craft potions. Players place ingredients into machines, which then process them into finished items. The system involves right-clicking to insert ingredients and another right-click to retrieve the final product. This mechanic is designed to streamline the crafting process and ensure that players can manage multiple tasks efficiently without requiring continuous manual input.</p>

                        <p><strong>How I Achieved This:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Interaction Mechanism:</strong> Players right-click on a machine with the correct ingredient to initiate processing, with corresponding sound effects to indicate success or failure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Processing Timer:</strong> Added a delay for processing to simulate the time needed to cook or craft.</li>
                            <li><strong>Result Notification:</strong> Designed a pop-up bubble above the machine to signal when the item is ready. This visual cue helps players easily identify when the product is ready and what the ingredient they used turned into.</li>
                            <li><strong>Item Retrieval:</strong> Designed a second right-click interaction to collect the finished item with out triggering cooking/crafting another item.</li>
                        </ul>
